## Group and disease parameters
################################################
##
## Each block represents an image group. A group consists of images all of which are the
## intended population of an AI (if there is an AI for that image type) or all of which
## will not be analyzed by any AIs.
##
## Each block has 4 lines:
## Line 1: Group name (provided by the user)
## Line 2: Percentage of patients that belong to this group with respect to number of
##         patients in the queue. This line must start with "groupProb" followed by a
##         value (between 0 and 1) provided by the user. All groupProb from all groups
##         must add up to 1.
## Line 3: Information about the disease involved in this group. This line must start
##         with "disease" followed by 4 inputs provided by the user. First is the disease
##         name, and second is the hierarchical ranking for the hierarchy queue scenario.
##         Third is the disease prevalence *within the group*, and forth is the
##         radiologist's mean reading time for diseased cases in minutes. If there are
##         more than 1 disease in the same group, all disease prevalence *within the group*
##         must add up to 1.
## Line 4: Radiologist's mean reading time for non-diseased cases in minutes. This line
##         must start with "meanServiceTimeNonDiseasedMin" followed by a value provided
##         by the user.
##
## Note that group names (Line 1) and disease names (Line 3) corresponds to the CADt AI
## in the next section.

## CADt AI diagnostic performance
################################################
##
## Each block includes information of 1 AI. For a CADt device that identifies multiple conditions, it should
## be broken down into 2 AIs each for one condition.
##
## Each block has 6 lines:
## Line 1: AI name (provided by the user)
## Line 2: The name of the group in which this AI will analyze all the images. This line must start with
##         "groupName" followed by the group name (defined above) provided by the user.
## Line 3: The disease within this group that the AI is trained to identify. This line must start with
##         "targetDisease" followed by the disease name (defined above) provided by the user.
## Line 4: True-positive fraction (TPF) of operating point of the AI i.e. sensitivity. This line must
##         start with "TPFThresh" followed by a value (between 0 and 1) provided by the user.
## Line 5: False-positive fraction (FPF) of operating point of the AI i.e. 1-specificity. This line must
##         start with "FPFThresh" followed by a value (between 0 and 1) provided by the user. If using
##         an input ROC curve, set this to `None` (not recommended).
## Line 6: Path to a text file with an imperical ROC curve (e.g. `../inputs/exampleROC.dat`). This line
##         must start with "rocFile" followed by the path provided by the user. In this file, the first
##         column is the false-positive fraction (x-axis in the ROC curve), and the second column is the
##         true-positive fraction (y-axis in the ROC curve). A bi-normal distribution is assumed to
##         parametrize the imperical ROC curve. The FPFThresh of the AI operating point will be based on
##         the TPFThresh (i.e. find the x-value of the ROC curve given the y-value). If using a user-
##         specified TPFThresh, set this to `None` (recommended).
